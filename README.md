## What is it

Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/google-foo-bar-challenge/
he Google Foo bar challenge has been known for the last 5 years or more as a secret process of hiring developers and programmers all over the world.
It is a secret process and the challenge consists of coding challenges of increasing difficulty as you go along.

The message reads like this.

You are speaking our language.  Up for a challenge!

In my case, it didn’t go the traditional way. During the ICC matches a few months ago, Google had updated their doodle with a small cricket game with players as ants.
Just out of curiosity, I went on for inspecting the page, when suddenly there was a comment under a ‘li’ tag.



“Up for a challenge. You are invited”. And there was a link and I opened it and it redirected me to a new page ‘Foo.bar’

Its kind of like a linux console where you get to solve the problems one by one upon opening a new problem directory.

## How do I get access
Normally, you'd get access to Google FooBar by normal searches related to programming, but there's a few ways to brute force your way into it.  I'm going to outline one.

### IT IS IMPORTANT TO USE CHROME FOR THIS

1. Go to google and search for "Dependency Injection"
2. Wait for the page to fully load
3. Copy the resulting URL
4. Repeat the following steps as quickly as possible 25 times
    a. Open a new tab
    b. Paste the URL
    c. Press enter
5. Once you've got 25 tabs open, go through the tabs.  On one or more of them, you'll see an a black bar at the top of the page asking if you're up for a challange.
6. Once you find one, you can close all the other tabs since you don't need them.

THERE'S YOUR INVITE!
